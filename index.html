    <h1>The Learn Enough Story"</h1>
    
        <p>
    
        Learn enough to be dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technichal sophistication</em>, the seeemingly
    
        magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
    
        everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, 
    
    
        Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboor the darn thing.
    
        We believe there are at least a billion people who can benefit from learning techinical
    
        sophistication, probably more. To join our movement, sign up for our offical email list now.
